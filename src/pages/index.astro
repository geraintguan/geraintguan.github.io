        <p>
          As Tech Lead at ClearSky Logic, I quickly began contributing to a
          high-impact project for a major client in a tightly regulated sector.
          I designed and documented a robust technical architecture meeting
          complex security requirements, led a team of three engineers with
          hands-on mentorship, and delivered proof-of-concept applications using
          .NET and Flutter. I also supported agile delivery through user story
          mapping, sprint planning, and defining technical task scope at a high
          level.

        <p>
          As Head of Developer Operations I established a Developer Operations
          department from scratch. I reduced errors with privacy-compliant
          monitoring and built a triage process to streamline technical
          resolution of customer issues and queries. I continued to scope and
          deliver key product features such as a new payment provider
          integration that helped us close major enterprise clients. I also
          supported the commercial team on sales and support calls in order to
          close and retain key clients.

          As Lead Software Engineer I led a product team of 2 to 3 engineers,
          scoping and delivering key features end-to-endâ€”including a Zapier
          integration and SAML. I introduced new tools and processes to the
          wider engineering team to boost developer productivity. I also
          supported the commercial team on sales and support calls in order to
          close and retain key clients.

          infrastructure costs by 20% and boosted stability. I introduced new
          technologies to enhance productivity and performance, while supporting
          both the wider engineering and commercial teams to resolve customer
          issues, helping win and retain key clients.
