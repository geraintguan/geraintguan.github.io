				Ever since I stumbled across programming and made my first command-line tic-tac-toe game
				written in C++ when I was 12, I've been enamoured with the art of writing code. After a
				stint in academia studying Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/"
					>University of Saint Andrews</a
				>
				I joined <a href="https://appointedd.com">Appointedd</a> and have had the great pleasure of working
				on a great product with an amazing team of people.
			</p>
			<p>
				I currently split my time between engineering management, product management, operational
				infrastructure, and programming. I love being able to have exposure to and work on a large
				number of areas as it provides ample opportunities to learn and grow.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my downtime messing around with electronics, making music, and playing games (both
				tabletop and digital).
