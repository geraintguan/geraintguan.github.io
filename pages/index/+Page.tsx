                Worked as both an engineering manager and a senior independent
                contributor. Continued to research and introduce new, modern
                technologies such as Storybook, GraphQL, and tRPC to improve
                developer productivity and experience. Collaborated with
                designers to research and implement a new design system to
                improve the consistency and development speed of the UI/UX of
                the product.
