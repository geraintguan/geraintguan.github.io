              I currently split my time between engineering management, product

                    Worked as both an engineering manager and a senior
                    independent contributor. Continued to research and introduce
                    new, modern technologies such as Storybook, GraphQL, and
                    tRPC to improve developer productivity and experience.
                    Collaborated with designers to research and implement a new
                    design system to improve the consistency and development
                    speed of the UI/UX of the product. My responsibilities in
                    this role are split between contributing as an engineering

                    As a senior contributor I worked on certain projects
                    independently with notable examples being:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>Web View Integration</b> - I built the front-end and
                      back-end of a web view designed to be embedded into one of
                      our partner's mobile apps. This web view has a subset of
                      the features of our main app with a user interface
                      designed to look similar to the partner's user interface.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Payment Integration</b> - I built both the front-end
                      and back-end of the OAuth v2.x part of a payment
                      integration along with utilities to easily work with the
                      resulting credentials. The end result was a scalable
                      framework that could then also be utilised for easily
                      building other OAuth v2.x integration pieces in our app.
